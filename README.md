# Docker image for single cell analysis

This image is intended to be used for single cell analysis with Python3 and R. It is an Ubuntu image with Anaconda3 installation and installation of the [single-cell-tutorial](https://www.github.com/theislab/single-cell-tutorial) by Luecken & Theis (2019). The latter brings several tools for single cell analysis to execute their case study for best practices in single cell analysis. The following is a list from their yml file:
